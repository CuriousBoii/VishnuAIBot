# This is an AI chatbot for Telegram.

## Aims are
- Become an AI information assistant that can be added to any group conversation on Telegram.
- Be able to answer questions about the context of the group. 
- Has to be able to take in pdf, doc and images and update its knowledge base.

## This project has been experiencing a few challenges.
1. The main challenge is that the bot is facing error 429 on open ai's api. This means that i need to upgrade to a subscription plan. I have run out of the credits that were given to me by OpenAI.

## Kindly try doing the below
1. Try other api's which are free. Obviously.
2. Try importing some Gen AI model and tweak it to suit me.

## The python packages required are
- python-telegram-bot
- openai
- python-dotenv

Please manually pip install them. As no script file has been created.
